# RockBuddy_Mobile

## Synopsis
Welcome to Rock Buddy Mobile! This program is a rock collection companion app for android. It will provide a way for rock collectors to digitize their collection. Users will be able to add samples, edit samples, remove samples, and view their collection. Samples include the rock name, rock id, composition, structures, and more. Users will be able to add multiple pictures per Sample if they wish.
This is a work in progress and once completed will act as my Stech Capstone project.

## Motivation
After developing Rock Buddy for desktop, I wanted to create a mobile edition to be more accessable. 

## How to Run
